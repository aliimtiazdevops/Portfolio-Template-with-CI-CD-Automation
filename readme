# Developer Portfolio Template

This **Developer Portfolio Template** is a responsive website designed for developers to showcase their skills and projects, deployed seamlessly using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline with GitHub webhooks. As a DevOps engineer, I crafted this to highlight automated deployment workflows, ensuring instant updates to GitHub Pages on every code push.
